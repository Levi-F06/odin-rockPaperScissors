# Rock Paper Scissors!
This is the first project using JavaScript for the Odin Project aswell as being my first project using neovim.

This project was updated to use DOM methods and as I have used DOM manipulation before, this new feature mostly taught me about using neovim bindings.

I'd say the project went pretty well and I am looking forward to my next Odin Project (etch a sketch) as well as future projects to come using JavaScript!
